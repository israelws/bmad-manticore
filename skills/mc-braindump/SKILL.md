# mc-braindump

The single most important input to the whole pipeline: the script stage may only use words that exist in this file (quote-or-cut). Capture generously.

## Steps

1. Load the studio config (`uv run {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --key modules.manticore`; empty means mc-setup has not run: stop and route the creator there) and this skill's own surface (`uv run {project-root}/_bmad/scripts/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root}`; run `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` now, `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` after this step, and hold `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as standing context). Resolve `paths` values against `{project-root}`. Read `project.json` and `brief.md`. Confirm stage is `braindump`. Read the format profile at `{formats-path}/<format>.md` for the project's `format` and any taste files it names.
2. ALWAYS offer camera-rolling capture (interview-recording mode) before the first question: if the creator records this session (constant frame rate), their spoken answers double as potential takes. The convention: they read each question aloud to the lens as "Question from the interviewer: <the question>" before answering; that spoken marker cue lets mc-cut segment the recording mechanically (cut the question reads, keep the answers). The cue is configurable (setup interview; cutplan.py `--marker-cues`); the older "question from claude" phrasing remains a documented alternative for studios that recorded with it. Whether or not the camera rolls, then interview, one question at a time, conversationally. Goal: get the creator talking at length in their own phrasing. Capture each answer into `braindump.md` verbatim as it is given; never rely on conversation memory for their exact words. Cover, in whatever order the conversation goes:
   - the core claim (what do they actually believe here),
   - who it is for and what they get,
   - the story or example they would tell a friend,
   - the strongest objection and their answer to it,
   - what everyone else gets wrong,
   - the demo/proof they can show,
   - what the viewer should SEE, asked verbatim: "what should the viewer see: demos, screens, drawings, motion, or moments you picture as a graphic?" (capture the answer word for word like every other; mc-outline and mc-beats read it as candidate visual moments),
   - how they would say the payoff in one breath.
3. Keep interviewing until their phrasing repeats (saturation) or they call it. Do not stop at a fixed question count.
4. Finalize `braindump.md`: VERBATIM capture of their answers, lightly grouped under the question headings. Their words untouched: keep their fragments, their slang, their fillers. No paraphrasing, no cleanup, no summarizing.
5. If the session was recorded: have the creator drop the file into the project's `raw/` and register it in project.json `sources` with role `"interview"` (see the PIPELINE.md contract). It is both braindump corpus and candidate takes.
6. Update project.json: set `artifacts.braindump`, append `braindump` to `stages_done`, and set `stage` to the entry after `braindump` in this project's `stages` array. Stop.

## Rules

- Never polish their phrasing. The point is a corpus of their real language.
- If the session arrives as an external recording/transcript instead of live conversation, save the raw transcript into the project's `raw/` first, then quote from it in braindump.md.
- Your questions are scaffolding; their answers are the artifact.
