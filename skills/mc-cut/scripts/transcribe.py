"""Word-level transcription for the cut stage (build-order item 1).

Usage:
    uv run {skill-root}/scripts/transcribe.py {projects-path}/<slug>/raw/<take> \
        -o {projects-path}/<slug>/transcript/words.json \
        [--provider auto|parakeet-mlx|onnx-asr] [--model <model-id>]

Contract:
    input     a media file (audio or video); the transcriber extracts audio via
              ffmpeg, so video containers (mp4, mov) are read directly.
    output    transcript JSON with word-level timestamps, confidence, and gap
              data, written to -o in a provider-neutral shape:
                  {
                    "provider": "parakeet-mlx",
                    "model":    "mlx-community/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3",
                    "media":    "<the media path as given>",
                    "duration": 172.67,
                    "text":     "<full transcript>",
                    "words": [
                      {"word": "Alright,", "start": 1.28, "end": 1.76,
                       "confidence": 0.9079, "i": 0,
                       "gap_before": 1.28, "gap_after": 0.0},
                      ...
                    ]
                  }
              times round to 2 decimals, confidence to 4. "i" is the word index.
              gap_before = start - previous word's end (first word: its start).
              gap_after  = next word's start - end (last word: duration - end).
              gaps never go negative (clamped to 0.0). "window_s"/"overlap_s"
              record the windowing this transcript was produced with.

              The JSON SHAPE is identical across providers, but gap VALUES are
              not comparable between lanes and neither lane's gaps are a
              timing source of truth. parakeet absorbs a pause into the
              preceding token's end, so an mlx-lane gap across real silence
              can read 0.0; the onnx lane caps derived word ends
              (WORD_END_CAP_FRAMES) precisely to avoid that, so its gaps are
              closer to real but still only advisory. Consumers deciding WHERE
              TO CUT must use the audio silence map from analyze_audio.py, not
              these gaps (see mc-cut/SKILL.md). Gaps remain useful as a weak
              signal for sentence-start detection and nothing else.
    provider  from the studio config [transcription] table; this script is the
              switch. "auto" (the default) picks per platform:
                  macOS Apple Silicon  -> parakeet-mlx (the reference lane)
                  everything else      -> onnx-asr (same weights, ONNX runtime)
              parakeet-mlx is the reference: free, local on Apple Silicon,
              native word timestamps, and empirically it keeps verbatim fillers
              ("uh", "um", "Hmm") that cutting depends on. onnx-asr runs the
              SAME parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3 weights (the istupakov ONNX conversion,
              onnx-asr model name "nemo-parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3"), so filler
              preservation and 80 ms frame-granular timestamps carry over on
              Windows, Linux, and Intel Macs. Metered API providers (for
              example elevenlabs-scribe or deepgram-nova3) are possible future
              OPT-IN lanes behind --provider and the [transcription] switch;
              none is implemented here, nothing defaults to them, and no API
              key name ships in any default.
    gpu       PEP 508 markers cannot detect GPUs, so the onnx-asr dependency
              ships with the cpu extra. On a CUDA box, escalate at the call
              site with a uv override:
                  uv run --with "onnx-asr[gpu,hub]" \
                      python {skill-root}/scripts/transcribe.py ...
              The `python` command is load-bearing: it makes uv skip this
              script's inline metadata, so ONLY the gpu extra installs.
              Running the script path directly with --with would merge the
              extras and co-install onnxruntime (cpu) with onnxruntime-gpu,
              which ship the same import package; ONNX Runtime does not
              support that, and the collision routinely leaves
              CUDAExecutionProvider unavailable. When onnxruntime reports
              CUDAExecutionProvider available, this script prefers it
              automatically; otherwise it runs on CPU, and if nvidia-smi is
              on PATH it prints a loud warning that the GPU escalation is
              needed (or failed) instead of silently running slow.
    chunking  EVERY lane windows. Both providers extract fixed 20 s windows
              with 3 s overlap via ffmpeg (16 kHz mono wav), recognize each
              window in ISOLATION, offset each chunk's timestamps by its
              window start, and merge at the overlap midpoint on word
              boundaries with a seam-repair pass (the two chunks time boundary
              words independently, so a take kept by both sides deduplicates
              and a take kept by neither restores from the nearer chunk): no
              word is split, duplicated, or dropped across chunks.

              This is NOT an onnx-asr accommodation, and short windows are not
              optional on either lane. parakeet's decoder SILENTLY DROPS whole
              spans inside long windows, worst around the many pauses of a
              teleprompter read: no error, no warning, just missing
              paragraphs. Measured on one 20.5 min take (2026-07-24):
                  chunk_duration=120  -> 3,446 words, 3 paragraphs lost
                  90 s isolated windows -> 3,308 words, still lossy
                  20 s isolated windows -> 3,546 words, complete
              An earlier version of this docstring claimed parakeet-mlx chunks
              long audio internally and the mlx lane called
              model.transcribe(<whole file>) with no chunk_duration. That was
              false twice over: the call OOMs on Apple Silicon above roughly
              15 min of 4K source (Metal buffer ceiling), and working around
              the OOM with a large chunk_duration silently loses speech. Do
              not "optimize" this back into fewer, longer windows, and do not
              rely on model.transcribe(..., chunk_duration=...) as a
              substitute for isolated windows.

              --window/--overlap tune the windowing; the defaults are the
              validated values and the recorded window_s/overlap_s in the
              output say what a given transcript actually used. Whatever the
              setting, verify_transcript.py is the gate that proves the
              result is complete.
    confidence  parakeet-mlx reports per-token confidence natively. The
              onnx-asr lane maps per-token scores when the runtime exposes
              them (logprobs are exponentiated into probabilities, values
              already in 0..1 pass through, everything clamps to 0..1). When
              the runtime exposes no per-token scores, confidence degrades to
              1.0 for every word: downstream consumers see "no signal", never
              a fabricated number.

Exit codes:
    0  transcript written
    1  transcription failed (model, ffmpeg, or provider runtime error)
    2  usage error (bad arguments, media not found)
    3  provider not implemented (future opt-in lanes)

Why parakeet-mlx over generic Whisper: cutting needs verbatim fillers ("um",
"uh", restarts) plus word gap data; Whisper normalizes exactly those away.
