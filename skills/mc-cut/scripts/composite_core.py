"""Shared compositing core for mc-cut's renderers (library module, not a CLI).

Imported by render_preview.py and render_final.py, which sit in this same
folder (a script's own directory is on sys.path when invoked via uv run, and
both scripts insert it explicitly for safety). This module holds everything
the two renderers share so the composited preview and the final render are
guaranteed to bake the same thing:

    - EDL timeline math (segment durations, internal boundary times)
    - timecode parsing/formatting
    - beat-table (beats/beats.md) parsing, tolerant of 0.x rows missing
      type/engine/asset per the PIPELINE.md tolerance rule
    - overlay resolution (one rendered file per beat id in a graphics dir)
    - ffmpeg filter_complex and command construction, with optional overlay
      compositing (ProRes 4444 / WebM / mp4 / PNG over the concat output)
    - chunk planning for segment-parallel final renders
    - encoder selection (videotoolbox on macOS; probed nvenc/qsv/amf ladder
      on Windows and nvenc/vaapi ladder on Linux; libx264 fallback)
    - disk-space estimation and preflight
    - ffmpeg -progress output parsing
    - ffprobe wrappers and boundary-frame extraction

No config discovery: every function takes explicit arguments. Stdlib only.

# --- fast preview compositing: proxies + overlay lanes -----------------------
#
# The first real project's preview render took 25+ minutes and stalled twice.
# Two costs multiplied:
#   (a) the cut sliced a 4K master into 234 segments, so every render did 234
#       seek+decodes into 4K video to build a 720p preview;
#   (b) all 56 overlays went into ONE filtergraph as a 56-deep overlay stack,
#       so every output frame walked 56 compositing steps whether or not any
#       overlay was actually on screen.
#
# Both have a cheap fix and neither needs a different tool:
#   (a) PROXY MASTERS. Transcode each source once, linearly, to the preview
#       height, and cut the preview from the proxy. A linear read plus 234
#       cheap seeks beats 234 expensive ones, the proxy is reused by every
#       later re-render, and the final render still cuts from the true master.
#   (b) OVERLAY LANES. Overlays are intervals in time and mostly do not
#       overlap. Pack them into the fewest non-overlapping lanes (greedy
#       interval scheduling), build each lane as a cheap time-sequential
#       CONCAT of transparent gaps and overlay clips, then stack only the
#       lanes. Stack depth becomes max-concurrent-overlays instead of
#       total-overlays: 56 became 2 on the real project.
#
# Measured together on that project: about 3 minutes instead of about an hour.

    ALL-INTRA (intra=True, the default) is what makes the fast preview lane

      8.3s early while total duration still matched the EDL exactly, so the
      wrong cut looked right in every check except a frame comparison.
    - Because every cut lands on a keyframe by definition, the preview can be
      a STREAM COPY instead of a re-encode. Measured on a 379-segment 16-min
      cut: 22 minutes of filter_complex re-encode became 2.8 seconds of

    -- an overlay changes pixels, which forces a re-encode.

    The EDL's fade_ms is deliberately not applied here. Audio fades exist to
    stop a click when a cut lands mid-waveform, and verify_edl already
    guarantees every boundary rests in audio-verified silence, so there is no
    discontinuity for a fade to hide. Measured across 8 random joins on a
    379-segment cut: unfaded peaks ran -31 to -44 dB against speech peaking
    at -9 dB, and tracked the faded render within 0.5 dB on most joins. If a
    future format ever cuts outside silence, this assumption dies with it.

    NOT WIRED INTO render_preview, and the reason is worth keeping:
        This is ~470x faster than the encode (2.8s vs 22min measured on a
        379-segment 16-minute cut, 340x realtime) and it is genuinely the
        same frames. But the concat demuxer emits DUPLICATE DTS wherever a
        segment runs only a frame or two, and the resulting file fails
        render_preview's decode validation. On that same cut: 125 decode
        errors plain, and 3 with every timestamp remedy tried (+genpts,
        avoid_negative_ts make_zero, video_track_timescale 30000, fps_mode
        passthrough, muxdelay 0). Never zero. Only 2 of 379 segments were
        under 0.1s, which is all it takes.

        Publishing that file would mean loosening a correctness gate to buy a
        speed number, so the speed moved instead of the gate: gate 2 review
        runs on the virtual timeline (edl_to_ffconcat.py), which is never
        muxed and therefore cannot have this problem, and which verifies

    """Build the filter_complex string for the whole timeline.

    streams selects which output streams the graph emits: "av" (default, the
    historic behavior, [outv] and [outa]), "video" ([outv] only, the audio
    chains and the audio concat omitted), or "audio" ([outa] only, the video
    chains and every overlay omitted). The video-only and audio-only forms
    back the incremental segment render, which persists video-only segments
    and rebuilds the audio whole every render; the "av" form is byte-for-byte
    unchanged so the preview and any av caller stay identical.

    source_index maps each source path to its ffmpeg -i input index. Each
    segment is trimmed from its source, PTS-reset, sized, given an in/out
    afade of fade_ms at its boundaries, and audio-normalized; all segments
    then concat.

    Sizing: when target=(W,H) is given every segment is normalized to that one
    frame (scale to fit with force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease, then pad and
    centre to WxH, setsar=1), so sources of different frame sizes or aspect
    ratios all become identical WxH inputs and the concat filter accepts them
    (mixed cam + screencast). target is set by the caller only when the
    timeline draws on more than one distinct source; the single-source fast
    path keeps the plain scale=-2:height (even width, square pixels; height
    None keeps native size), unchanged.

    Audio: a source with no audio stream (audio_map[source] is False and a
    silence_index is supplied) draws silence from the shared anullsrc input at
    silence_index instead of a real [idx:a], so screen recordings without audio
    do not fail with "Stream specifier :a matches no streams". Every audio
    chain ends in aresample=48000,aformat=channel_layouts=stereo so sources
    with different sample rates or channel layouts (44.1k cam + 48k screencast)
    concat cleanly. audio_map None means every source has audio (the historic
    behavior).

    overlays (optional) are dicts {index, start, dur, image} whose 'index' is
    the ffmpeg input index of the overlay file; each is composited over the
    concat output in start order (format=rgba, scaled to overlay_size when
    given, PTS shifted to its timeline start, overlay with eof_action=pass and
    an enable window). With overlays the chain ends in format=yuv420p so the
    output stays player-safe. Final labels are always [outv]/[outa].

    hwupload=True ends the video chain in format=nv12,hwupload instead, for
    encoders that only take hardware frames (vaapi); the caller must also set
    up the device (encoder_init_flags).

    encode replaces the default preview encode args (libx264 crf 28 veryfast

# the current render. Two processes interleaved bytes into one path and the

# check was the container duration, which a corrupt file still reports
# happily.
#
# Three defences, all needed:
#   1. Never write the deliverable path directly. Render to a unique temp
#      path and os.replace it into place, which is atomic on one filesystem,
#      so a reader sees either the old file or the new one and never a
#      half-written one.
#   2. Key a render by its CONTENT, and re-check that key just before
#      publishing. A render whose EDL changed underneath it is stale and must
#      discard its output instead of clobbering a newer one. Content keying
#      beats process cancellation because it also catches a crashed, detached,
#      or forgotten job, which is exactly what happened.
#   3. Prove the file decodes before calling it a deliverable.
