"""Transcript completeness gate: prove the transcript is not missing speech.

Usage:
    uv run {skill-root}/scripts/verify_transcript.py \
        {projects-path}/<slug>/transcript/words.json \
        --audio-map {projects-path}/<slug>/cut/audio-map.json \
        [--wpm 198] [-o {projects-path}/<slug>/cut/transcript-check.json]

Why this exists:
    On the first real project (2026-07-24) the transcriber silently dropped
    three whole paragraphs of clearly-spoken content. No error, no warning.
    Everything downstream ran on the hole: candidates, EDL, cutplan, render,
    and a passed gate 2. The dropped regions looked like dead air to the
    cutter, which nearly deleted three paragraphs of the actual video.

    Nothing in the pipeline ever checked. This script is that check, and it
    RUNS BEFORE CANDIDATE DETECTION. It exits non-zero, and a non-zero exit
    means stop: do not cut against this transcript.

The checks, in order of what actually catches things:

  1. COVERAGE SCAN (the decisive one, exit 1 on failure)
     Audio that is above the silence floor but has no transcribed words is
     DROPPED SPEECH. Computed as the complement of (silence + word spans):
     anything left over is audible, un-transcribed, and therefore missing.
     Contiguous leftovers are clustered and any cluster at or above
     --min-drop seconds fails the gate, reported with timecodes so the
     region can be re-transcribed in isolation and spliced.

     This check is deliberately built from the AUDIO side, not from word
     gaps. Word gaps cannot be trusted: parakeet absorbs pauses into the
     preceding word's end, so a gap across real silence reads about 0.0 (see
     analyze_audio.py). A check that scanned word gaps would inherit exactly
     the bug it is meant to catch.

  2. WORD-RATE SANITY (exit 1 on failure, but read the caveat)
     Effective words per minute over SPEECH time (dead air excluded, which
     wall-clock rate does not do) against the creator's configured wpm.

     CAVEAT, measured on the real failure: this check would NOT have caught
     it. The broken transcript had 3,446 words against a good 3,546, a 3
     percent deficit, because three missing paragraphs are a small fraction
     of a 20 minute take. Against speech time it reads 224 wpm versus 231
     for the good one; against wall-clock, 168 versus 173. Either way it
     sails past any sane floor. The original bug report proposed a 55
     percent floor and that would have passed the broken transcript too.

     So this check is real but narrow: it catches CATASTROPHIC failure (a
     lane that returned half a file, a wrong-language model, a silent
     truncation) and nothing subtler. Check 1 is the one that catches
     dropped paragraphs. Do not let this check's presence create confidence
     that check 1 is optional.

  3. CONFIDENCE CLUSTERS (advisory, never fails the gate)
     A run of near-zero-confidence words is a soft signal to re-check that
     region by ear. Reported, never blocking. On the onnx lane confidence
     degrades to 1.0 when the runtime exposes no scores, so absence of this
     signal means nothing.

Contract:
    input     words.json from transcribe.py, plus audio-map.json from
              analyze_audio.py (both must describe the same media).
    output    optional -o report JSON: {"ok", "checks": {...},
              "dropped_regions": [...], "accepted": [...], "word_rate": {...},
              "low_confidence": [...]}
    summary   json.dumps on stdout either way.

Exit codes:
    0  transcript passes; safe to build candidates against
    1  transcript INCOMPLETE or implausible; do not proceed
    2  usage error (missing file, bad arguments, media mismatch)

Remediation when this fails: re-run the take (see transcribe.py's `chunking`
note for the measured window sizes), then re-verify.

When the finding is a FALSE POSITIVE, the escape valve:
    Not every audible span with no words is lost speech. A laugh, a music
    bed, an off-mic aside, or a long breath above the noise floor all read
    the same way to a coverage scan. So the creator can listen to a flagged
    region and sign it off:

        --accept-region 612.4-618.9 --reason "audience laugh, no speech"

    The acceptance must FULLY cover the flagged region, --reason is
    mandatory, and both land in the report, so the override is a recorded
    decision rather than a silent one. This is the same shape as preflight's
    --allow-qc-defects: the gate stays blocking by default, and the only way
    past it is a human saying why. A gate with no acknowledged override gets
    worked around in ways that leave no trace, which is worse.

STATUS: implemented (pure logic covered by
scripts/tests/test-verify_transcript.py).
