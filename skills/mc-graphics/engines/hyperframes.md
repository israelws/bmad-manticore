# Engine: HyperFrames

Default engine for everything the pipeline renders as motion: per-video overlay beats, stingers, karaoke captions, and footage-facing effects. Apache 2.0, fully local, free. `npx hyperframes render` drives HTML/CSS/GSAP frame-by-frame in headless Chrome and exports overlay-only ProRes 4444 MOV with alpha. Everything the pipeline uses is the local CLI and render path; the hosted conveniences (HeyGen cloud-render credits, the Studio web app, Claude Design, Figma import, AWS Lambda / Cloud Run) are never a dependency, and no HeyGen account is required.

## The skills are the source of truth

HyperFrames is pre-1.0 and moves fast, so this file never transcribes its full capability list or pins a version: that would only ship stale knowledge to every creator. The agent loads HyperFrames' own Agent Skills instead, which teach the current authoring patterns (the `data-*` attributes, GSAP timeline registration, the component vocabulary, every effect) and refresh themselves.

- mc-setup installs them (`npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --all --full-depth` for the whole catalog, or `npx hyperframes skills update` for the maintained core set), so the capability surface is known from the beats stage onward. mc-graphics installs them on first use if setup was skipped.
- `npx hyperframes init` refreshes the core set plus whatever is already installed; `npx hyperframes skills check` reports drift and `npx hyperframes skills update` applies it. Refresh, never blindly expand.
- The always-current capability index is https://hyperframes.heygen.com/llms.txt. When a beat needs something, consult the installed skills and that index rather than this file.

The engine WORKSPACE still initializes lazily on the first graphics run (below); only the lightweight skill knowledge lands at setup. The harness loads skills by its own resolution; nothing here is specific to one agent.

## What it can do

All local and free. These are categories to reach for, not the live list (the skills and the index are canonical):

- Block catalog (`npx hyperframes add`, 100+ blocks): code animations, WebGL shader transitions, caption styles including karaoke, lower thirds, social cards, data viz and maps, VFX, and 3D device showcases with live HTML screens. Theme every block through tokens.json.
- Footage-facing media effects apply to the video and stills, not only to overlays: color grading with presets, project-local `.cube` LUTs, vignette, grain, blur, and pixelate via a `data-color-grading` attribute; background removal to a transparent overlay; HTML-in-Canvas to run WebGL shaders and 3D geometry over the DOM. These open real pipeline moves without leaving the local renderer: propose a few graded looks over the actual footage and let the creator pick, or cut a subject off its background.
- Delivery reach: ProRes 4444 MOV, VP9 alpha WebM, MP4, GIF, and PNG sequences; HDR10 (BT.2020 PQ or HLG, 10-bit H.265) when the sources are HDR; 4K via the Chrome device scale factor.

## Setup

- The engine workspace lives at the creator's `{engines-path}/hyperframes/`, initialized on the first graphics run: `npm install hyperframes@latest`, plus the skills above. Never carry a version number in module docs. Record the resolved engine version in the workspace package.json and upgrade deliberately rather than floating mid-project.
- Pull the blocks a beat needs before authoring: `npx hyperframes add`. Theme every block through `{brand-path}/tokens.json`.
- `@hyperframes/studio` is the local timeline GUI with real bidirectional HTML sync (drag a beat in the GUI, the code updates; hand-edit the code, the GUI hot-reloads). Use it for timing nudges after mc-graphics gets close.

## Why this engine and not Remotion

Remotion is not used, recorded here so the decision is not relitigated per video. Its license is free only up to 3 people, and Manticore is a distributed module, so shipping it would hand every creator at a 4+ person company a licensing obligation they did not opt into; HyperFrames is Apache 2.0 with no threshold. Its React model also bought nothing, because in a frame-deterministic renderer state IS a function of frame index: every job it might hold here is a paused GSAP timeline driven by the beat table. Remotion remains the stronger pick for React shops rendering at massive scale. That is not this pipeline.

## Jobs

- Per-video overlay beats: the default lane, delivered as ProRes 4444 alpha MOVs.
- Brand stinger and transitions: ONE composition rendered twice, VP9 yuva420p WebM for OBS and ProRes 4444 MOV for the editor lane. Keep it 1 to 2 seconds; transparent WebM renders slowly.
- Shorts karaoke captions: word-level highlight driven by the transcript's word timestamps, built from a registry caption block themed through tokens.json.
- Footage-facing effects: color-graded looks and background removal on the source video and stills, when a beat or the Production Bible calls for them.

## Rules

- Favor the catalog and the installed skills before authoring from scratch; a hand-built comp is the last resort, not the first.
- Footage-facing effects use the local render (`data-color-grading`, background removal, HTML-in-Canvas), never a hosted API or credits.
- Brand-themed blocks live in the engine workspace and are reused across projects; per-video comps live in each project's `graphics/` folder.
- Dual-render targets share one source of truth; never maintain two stinger comps.
- WebM VP9 alpha is for browser and OBS consumption only. Editors ignore its alpha channel and render transparent areas black, so the editor lane always takes the ProRes 4444 MOV.
- A render is not done until `{skill-root}/scripts/render_verify.py` has extracted frames and they have been visually checked.
