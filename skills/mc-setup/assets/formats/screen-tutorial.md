# Format: screen-tutorial

Talking head plus screen recording. The teaching happens on screen; the pipeline adds structure and emphasis around real UI.

## Style philosophy

- Real UI only. Generated b-roll is BANNED in this format (UI accuracy rule); that is why the assets stage is absent from the stage list.
- Beat types extend talking-head with: zoom/pan on the screen recording, UI callouts (boxes, arrows, key-press chips), and step counters.
- Callouts use the brand accent color on a subtle border stroke (per `{brand-path}/tokens.json`); never obscure the UI element being discussed, point at it.
- Screen recordings are captured at native resolution, constant frame rate, and cursor visible.
- Creativity: restrained. The UI is the star; graphics clarify, never decorate. Vary callout placement and pacing, not treatment. (mc-retro tunes this line per format.)

## Engine defaults

- Overlays and callouts: HyperFrames.
- Zoom/pan moves are executed in the creator's editor on the screen-recording clip (keyframed transform), planned as beats with anchor words like any other graphic.

## Templates

- None yet.

## Learnings
