# Format: livestream-pack

Not a video. One run of mc-stream-pack producing a complete OBS asset pack from brand tokens. The final gate is the creator loading the pack into OBS and approving the look live.

## Style philosophy

- Scenes must read at a glance on a busy live layout; one design language across the whole pack.
- Creativity: bold but consistent. Strong shapes and confident type, always inside the brand system; the pack is the channel's live face, not a per-show experiment. (mc-retro tunes this line per format.)

## Pack contents

- Static scenes as self-contained local HTML (starting-soon with countdown, BRB, ending, full overlay). OBS browser sources render local HTML transparent by default; no server.
- Scenes are reactive via the `window.obsstudio` JS API (countdown resets on scene activation, lower thirds re-trigger entrance on visibility) with a plain-browser fallback.
- Stinger transition: one HyperFrames comp rendered twice (VP9 yuva420p WebM for OBS, ProRes 4444 MOV for the editor lane), 1 to 2 seconds. Baked alpha scene and lower-third deliverables list WebM VP9 alpha (libvpx-vp9 yuva420p) for OBS on any platform alongside the ProRes 4444 MOV; render_verify.py can transcode and verify the WebM from the ProRes master in one step.
- vMix note: vMix rejects MP4 stingers and prefers PNG sequences; when the live tool is vMix, deliver a PNG sequence or the ProRes 4444 MOV instead of WebM. Wirecast takes the ProRes 4444 MOV directly.
- Lower thirds and topic cards as self-contained local HTML, styled from tokens.json, drivable by SPX-GC or an OBS browser source for click-to-trigger later.

## Verification, not vibes

- Playwright screenshots of every scene at 1920x1080 over a checkerboard to prove alpha and layout.
- ffprobe on the stinger for the right pixel formats.

## Out of scope in v1

- NodeCG (over-engineered for an asset pack).
- Alert-event plumbing (StreamElements' free custom-widget slot accepts our HTML if alerts are ever wanted).

## Learnings
